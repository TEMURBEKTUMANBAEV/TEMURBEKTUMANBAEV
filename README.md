--------------------------------------------
Hi everyone! My name is Temurbek Tumanbaev and I'd like to tell you a bit about myself. I'm 19 years old and I was born on February 19th under the sign of Aquarius. I think it's a very interesting zodiac sign because it usually means independence and originality, which are very important to me. Ever since I was a kid, I was into sports, especially basketball. I dreamt of becoming a professional basketball player, and thanks to my hard work and dedication, I achieved that goal. I graduated from Lenin school and currently, I'm studying at DevX IT school with a specialization in SDET. I think it's a very promising field that will allow me to develop and utilize my skills and knowledge in creating and testing software. I'm always ready to take on new challenges and move forward. I enjoy learning and improving my skills, and I'm sure that this will help me achieve even greater success in life. I'm also passionate about traveling and learning about new cultures, and I hope that in the future, I'll have the opportunity to travel and see the world even more. Overall, I think I'm a young and ambitious person, ready to overcome challenges and pursue my goals. I believe in myself and my abilities, and I'm confident that in the future, I'll have many opportunities to achieve success. Thanks for reading, and see you soon!

* ‚ö°  Hey there! I just wanted to add a few things about myself that I think are worth mentioning. For one, I really enjoy expressing myself through art. I love to draw and paint in my spare time and have even sold a few of my pieces. It's just such a relaxing and therapeutic activity for me. I also love to learn and explore new things. I'm really interested in history and philosophy and love to read books about them. I also enjoy watching movies and TV shows, especially if they have a compelling storyline and interesting characters. Despite being young, I'm very focused and driven. I take my responsibilities seriously and am determined to make a positive impact on the world. I'm always looking for ways to improve myself and those around me. My family and friends have always been very supportive and I'm really grateful for them. Anyway, I just wanted to share a bit more about myself. Thanks for reading and take care!
